For standard threaded programs, it is usually necessary to write a lot of extra code to add multi-threading to a program. Instead, OpenMP employs a series of pragmas, or special compiler directives, that tell the compiler how to parallelize the code.\n",

        "\n",
        "In many cases, static scheduling is sufficient. However, there is an implicit assumption with static scheduling that all components take about the same amount of time. However, if some components take longer than others, a **load balancing** issue can arise. In the case of the drug design example, different ligands take longer to compute than others. Therefore, a dynamic scheduling approach is better.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, note that speedup is non-linear, especially at higher number of threads. While increasing the number of threads is supposed to generally _improve_ the run time of a program, it usually does not scale linearly with the number of cores. This occurs for a number of reasons. First, at higher number of threads, it is more likely that the serial components of a program (such as thread creation overhead, and any other necessary serial operations that must take place before the parallel code can run) start dominating run time (see **Amdahl’s Law**). Second, **resource contention** on the CPU or memory from other processes can cause slow downs. A related measure called **efficiency** measures how _well_ a program uses the cores assigned to it.\n",
